            <p> It's my first game project that was fun to play. It's 3D top-down shooter for 2 player. We didn't know much about multiplayer programming so this game has only local coop for 2 players. This game was developed during ZEMJAM 2023 in just one and a half days.</p>
            <p> I was responsible for programming and design of shooter mechanics. I really enjoyed making shooter game and one of my goals make TimeHunters 2 which will be much bigger game with multiplayer</p>

            <h2>Remind</h2>
            <img src="img/remind_logo.png" alt="Project Image">
            <p>Simple 2D puzzle game that tells story about 30-years-old woman who tries to get by as a housewife diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
            <p>I was the only programmer in the team and I also participated in making the whole design of the game. This game is quite small, but I added it because of visual style that I'm proud of.</p>

            <p>Beyond the Breach is a single player 3D puzzle game that tells story of a deviant robot trying to escape free.</p>
            <p>My first game on Steam. We were making this game for 3 month and decided to release it on Steam to learn how to work with Steamworks.SDK and how to work with community.  It was a great experiment, and I'm so happy we did that.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for all gameplay mechanics, save system and checkpoint system.</p>

            <p>I'm so proud of this project. We made it in just 2 days for Global Game Jam 2024, and we really enjoyed this result.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for all gameplay mechanics. Assets were bought in Unity Asset Store.</p>

            <h2>Rubi Logger</h2>
            <img src="img/rubi_logger.png" alt="Project Image">
            <p>Rubi Logger is an asset for Unity Asset Store that I hope can help Unity developers with their log system. Rubi Logger provides more flexible and clean logging for Unity projects of any scale. It also supports On-Screen and In-File logging.</p>
            <p>It started as a tool for my future projects, but I decided to make a Unity Asset to share it with others.</p>
            <p>When I first released it price was 7$, but then I made it free because this was no demand. :( </p>
